A minesweeper game built using MEEN (Mysql,Express,Ejs and Node) stack. I agree the codebase is pretty ugly and nothing less than a blunder but pardon as this was one of my very initial projects. Most of the things are implemented in non standard way and need to be redone, will surely make it an example of one of my good codebase's someday.

Basic Overview

A 8By8 matrix based classic minesweeper game with some fixed number of bombs (which I won't let you know here).
With a flag placing functionality and timer to record your performance. It also includes an area for a small chat for all the currently active users implemented via sockets.
